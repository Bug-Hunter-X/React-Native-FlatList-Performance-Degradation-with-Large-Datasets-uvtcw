This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with large datasets.  The problem stems from inefficient rendering caused by improperly configured `keyExtractor` props or data updates leading to unnecessary re-renders. The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the issue.  The solution (`FlatListBugSolution.js`) provides a corrected implementation with a properly configured `keyExtractor` and optimized data handling to prevent excessive re-renders and improve performance.
